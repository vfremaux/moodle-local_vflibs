This is a compilation of additional libraries i'm using often in my plugins.

The JQPlot library is the MIT Plotting Library that offers a nice set of
HTML5 graphing capoabilities using easy to build JS objects.

Antiword is an old Word to Text converter for the search engine document
indexing capability.

XPdf is a PDF to text converter used in search engine

TCPdf is a newer version of TCPDF. 
// Version     : 6.0.054
// Begin       : 2002-08-03

Moodle still uses an old version untill 2.8
This TC PDF adds the insternal storing of the page format and
page orientation so it can be queried back from the document.
